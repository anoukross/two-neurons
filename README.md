# two-neurons
The Neuron project - S2/S3


Test 2 verifies whether the second neuron receives correctly the postsynaptic current from the first neuron. First without delay than with a delay of 0.15ms. If the time = (time at which Neuron 1 has spikes + the delay), the membrane potential of the second neuron should have increased of J(net.getCurrentWeights()[0][1]=0.1 mV).

I still have to understand why the delay is of 0.14ms instead of 0.15ms.
